Acknowledgements
----------------

- This package's core functionality relies substantially on the geopandas package.
- The idea to use inset axes for this package came from Cimbali. A helpful explanation on utilizing segmented
colormaps came from JohanC. As mentioned in the comments, the function for discretizing matplotlib colormaps was
inspired by an example provided in Jake VanderPlas' [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
